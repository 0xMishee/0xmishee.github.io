I’m not entirely sure what this blog will turn into, but I just needed a place to write down some thoughts about all of this.

Lately, I’ve been taking my Obsidian note-taking more seriously and started using the graph view to uncover potential gaps I might have missed. For example, a lot of my notes share common keywords like a specific PLC type, a network interface, or an enterprise device, but I haven’t written anything substantial about those topics. That gap feels like an opportunity, either to expand my notes or to identify where my own knowledge might be thin.

It’s gone surprisingly well. The graph view started to fill out, and I began spotting areas where I could dig deeper. It worked especially well for study-related notes compared to my network lab ones. The lab notes were interesting to see in the broader network, but they didn’t really provide actionable insights. Still, it helped me organize my books, notes, and papers more effectively.

More recently, I’ve tried using it on detection content, not for any specific reason at first, mostly just to see how it would look with a large cluster of interconnected nodes. Visually, it turned out great. Even better, I started noticing connections between detection content and articles that I hadn’t picked up on before. That got me thinking about the potential scale of this if I had access to the same kind of data I work with, like intelligence reports, wikis, and broader content, the insights could be on a completely different level.

I’ve also been thinking about setting up some automation to pull and standardize data so it’s easier to digest. With that, I could design a more deliberate naming convention and tag system. I’m imagining different workflows or scenarios where I can quickly get a clear sense of the context I’m working in.

For example, if someone asks whether we have coverage for specific techniques or detections, I could easily navigate to those nodes using memorable keywords. From there, I could connect those detections to intelligence reports we’ve gathered internally or to incident reports that might highlight similar activity from the past.

Another scenario could be during onboarding of a new system, application, or data source. My notes for that project could automatically surface related information from what already exists, whether for context, learning, or finding relevant articles and coverage that tie into the project. The goal is to create a setup where my knowledge base doesn’t just store information but actively helps me discover connections and make better use of what I already know.

I’ve created a set of tags that I’m exclusively allowed to use. I believe that without proper self-governance over which tags I can add, it would quickly turn into a mess of inconsistent capitalization, misspellings, and confusion when trying to make sense of everything later. To manage this, I made a page outlining the rules of the system and named my tagging framework “namespace.”

Each document I create can have one or more values from this namespace, ideally several at once to capture intent, state, purpose, data, context, and metadata accurately.

I’ll be back with an update on how the progress is going.

Cheers!
